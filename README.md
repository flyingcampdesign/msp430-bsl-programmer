FCD-PRG01
---------

The FCD-PRG01 is a USB bootstrap loader (BSL) programmer for the Texas Instruments MSP430 microprocessor. For designs where low cost or small form factor prohibit the integration of custom programming logic or a large JTAG header, the FCD-PRG01 enables in-system programming by including a single 6 pin header in the target device design.

Originally designed to work with the cross platform TinyOS toolchain, the FCD-PRG01 provides an open source, cross platform alternative to platform dependent development tools for the MSP430 microprocessor.

The FCD-PRG01 integrates a USB-to-serial converter and on board regulated power supply into a small USB dongle, allowing programming and test capability over a single interface. It exposes a standard 6 pin, 0.1” header which can be used to interface to the target board via a device specific cable harness. This modular approach provides designers with the flexibility to select the optimal physical programming interface for the unique design constraints of each target platform.
